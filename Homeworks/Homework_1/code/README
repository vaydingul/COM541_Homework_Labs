The homework folder consists of two seperate folders, namely src and data.

src:
    This folder includes necessary code files, which are "main.jl" and "NBClassifier.jl"

data:
    The necessary data should be positioned in this folder.

Overall hierarchy of the file system should be displayed like following:

homework1
|__data
    |__acllmdb
        |__test
            |__neg
                |__ ...
            |__pos
                |__ ...
            .
            .
            .
        |__train
            |__neg
                |__ ...
            |__pos
                |__ ...
            |__unsup
                |__ ...
            .
            .
            .
        |__imdb.vocab
        |__imdbEr.txt
        |__README
|__src
    |__main.jl
    |__NBClassifier.jl
|__README

After placing data file according to the above tree structure, one can execute the program by doing following:

    - In command window, go to "src" folder.
    - Type "julia main.jl"


Above instructions should be sufficient to execute program without any error.
